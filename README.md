Having worked a continuous tender for GoDaddy and A2Hosting I am currently looking for my next position of a Linux System Administrator / Engineer / Web Hosting Technical Support. Did I say I worked for Google too as an outsourcer?

Meanwhile I hone and improve my skills. 

My coolest achievement I am the most proud of is developing for GoDaddy's part of Confluence / Jira. I came up with a combination of jQuery / CSS / HTML / JS idea that nobody of their developers could think of. They were stuck. My code was accepted and implemented and it is still there working in action. :-) Yes, I am boasting / lauding myself [loading in runtime too]. 😄

I adore music and love playing any musical instruments I can get my hands on. Creativity is my middle name basically in anything I do :)
